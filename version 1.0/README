Automatic Multiple Experiment Simulation and Fitting

Windows To use the program in Windows, you can simply download the binary and paste it in the directory with the input and spectral files. Using a Ccmd (command prompt) window, cd into this directory and run the program with the command:

AMES-Fit.exe input_filename

Unix No biraries are provided for a UNIX-like environment (Mac or Linux) but these can be created by compiling the program with the command (assuming GSL is installed): g++ AMES-Fit.cpp -o AMES-Fit -fopenmp -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm -O3 -march=native

And then run in the terminal (or schedular, such as SLURM) with the command:

./AMES-Fit input_filename
